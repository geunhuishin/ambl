0. stock solutions for M9 minimal media
   - autoclave
     - M9 salts (5x): tdw 600 ml + m9 salts (5x), autoclave
     - 1M MgSO4:
     - 1M CaCl2: 
     - 3% agar medium:
   - filter sterilise
     - 10% (w/v) d-glucose:
     - 10mg/ml thiamine hydrochloride: 
   - storage
     - rt
       - M9 salts (5x)
       - 1M MgSO4
       - 
     - 4*C

1. M9 minimal media (solution)
   - ingredients
      - M9 salts (5x): 100 ml
      - 1M MgSO4: 1 ml
      - 1M CaCl2: 50 ul
      - 10% (w/v) Glucose: 20 ml
      - 10mg/ml thiamine hydrochloride: 16 ml
      - autoclaved tdw: 363 ml
   - 

2. M9 minimal media (2.178% agar)
   - ingredients
      - M9 salts (5x): 100 ml
      - 1M MgSO4: 1 ml
      - 1M CaCl2: 50 ul
      - 10% (w/v) Glucose: 20 ml
      - 10mg/ml thiamine hydrochloride: 16 ml
      - 3% agar medium: 363 ml 
   - how-to
     1. mix by adding ingredients inside agar medium bottle
     2. microwave agar medium and slowly cool down until it reaches 62*C
     2. add M9 salts first 
     3. wait until reaches 52*C and add rest of the stock solutions
        - while waiting for agar medium to cool down, prepare rest of the solutions inside the 50 ml falcon tube.
        - take chilled media out already.

#### SENSE-seq condition optimisation
- object: optimal OD600 value for RNAsnap 
- notes: final concentration of supplements 
  - kanamycin, Km (50 ug/ml)
  - anhydrotetracyclin, aTc (10 nM)
- protocol (until cell extraction)
  1. inoculate LC-E75 dtyrR (tyrA, pykF, ctrl, aroG-targeting sgRNA harbouring plasmids) to Km supplemented M9 minimal media and incubate overnight at 37*C, 180rpm.
  2. 1/100 dilute overnight culture media to fresh M9 minimal media (+Km), same incubation condition.
  3. prepare 250 ml flasks (samples*3) for biological triplicate
     - prepare 3x volume and distribute
     - make initial OD600 = 0.005
       - 500 ul of cell media (OD600 = 0.5) + 50 ml of fresh media
  4. extract 5ml of cell media when its OD600 value reaches at:
     - 0.1 ~ 0.2 (early)
     - 0.2 ~ 0.4 (mid)
     - 0.4 ~ 0.8 (late)
  5. centrifuge extracted cell media at 7,000 rpm and discard supernatant.
  6. keep them inside the deep freezer and proceed to next step later.
