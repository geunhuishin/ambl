## week 11

### SENSE-seq condition optimisation (record, refer to the week10 for original protocol)

> continued from last week

#### Protocol (until cell extraction) and results

  1. inoculate LC-E75 dtyrR (tyrA, pykF, ctrl, aroG-targeting sgRNA harbouring plasmids) to Km supplemented M9 minimal media and incubate overnight at 37*C, 180rpm.
     - from 23:00 until (next day) 9:00, for 10 hours.
     
  2. 1/100 dilute overnight culture media to fresh M9 minimal media (+Km), same incubation condition.
     - cell growth varied from 0.5 to 1.2 (highest value for LC-E75 dtyrR)
     - instead of 1/100, OD600 value was set to 0.05 and grown for 4 hours.
     - after 4 hours, OD600 value was near 0.5.
     
  3. prepare 250 ml flasks (samples*3) for biological triplicate.
     - prepare 3x volume, add supplements (Km and aTc) and distribute.
     - make initial OD600 = **0.005**
       - 500 ul of cell media (OD600 = 0.5) + 50 ml of fresh media
       
  4. extract 5ml of cell media when its OD600 value reaches at:
     - ~~0.1 ~ 0.2 (early)~~
     - ~~0.2 ~ 0.4 (mid)~~
       - ~~0.4 ~ 0.8 (late)~~
          unlike the original plan, cell media was extracted at **four** different time points.

  5. centrifuge extracted cell media at 3,200 rpm for 10 minutes and discard supernatant.
  
  6. transfer the remaining supernatant and cell pellet to 1.5 ml ep tube, centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and discard supernatant.
  
  7. keep them inside the deep freezer and proceed to next step later.
  
#### Protocol (from RNA prep to qPCR)
  
1. RNA prep from cells
	- RNA Snap from ~~5 mL~~ of culture (* 10^8 cells로 맞춰주자)
		* Suspend the cell pellet in the 100uL buffer (18 mM EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 1% **2-mercaptoethanol, 95% formamide (RNA grade)**)  -> *이때 아예 얼려버리자.*
			* formamide, 특별 관리 물질
			* bold체로 된 건 후드에서 열고 닫고 사용할 것.
			* 중요) **2-mercaptoethanol, 95% formamide (RNA grade)**) 모두 인체에 유해한 물질이므로, 폐기에 있어서도 유의해야 할 사항이 많다. 
				1. Reverse transcription 전까지의 모든 과정을 흄후드에서 진행할 것.
				2. 액체 폐기물이 아닌, 고형 폐기물 처리를 위해, 사용하고 남은 95% formamide를 킴테크에 적셔 falcon tube에 밀봉하여 버린다.
	* (heatblock에 미리 온도 맞춰둘 것) 95℃ for 7 min, and then spin down at 16000g for 5min at RT, take supernatant  
	- RNA purification을 하면 20 uL정도 elution 될 것
		- RNeasy (Qiagen kit) 사용할 것
		* 300~1000 ng/uL of total RNA (elution volume 및 농도를 잘 조절할 것)
2. DNase I treatment
       * take 20 uL of 100 ng/uL normalized RNA samples for DNase I treatment  
           * to 2 ug of total RNA  
           * make 100 ng/uL for DNase I treatment (농도를 맞춰줄 것)
       * add 2.22 uL of Buffer and 1 uL of DNase I for each sample - 1 hr (40 min) at 37C in thermocycler, and 75C for 10 min for DNase I inactivation  
       * no column purification is needed here before reverse transcription
3. Reverse transcription
   - Mix the following components:  (RT를 하기 위한 전과정)
     - 5 uL of DNase I treated total RNA sample   
     - 2 uL of gene specific primer (stock: **10 uM**, final: 2 uM)
     - reverse primer only (*obviously)
       - 1 uL of dNTP mix (10mM)  
       - **6.5 uL** Nuclease free water  
   - Incubate at 65℃ for 5 minutes.  
   - (65℃에서 꺼내자마자) Chill on ice for at least 1 minute.  
   - Mix and add the following:
     - 4 uL of 5x RT buffer (버퍼 같은 건 미리 꺼내둘 수 있음)
     - 0.5 uL of RNase inhibitor (ribolock thermo scientific)
     - 1 uL of Maxima RT  
   - Incubate with the following protocol:
     - 50℃ for 30 minutes
     - 85℃ for 5 minutes (reaction termination)
     - 4℃ for infinite hold  
4. RNaseH treatment (added 1 uL of RNaseH, 30 min reaction at 37C)
   - 위 RT rxn 믹스에 바로 treatment
   - Column purification required - 10 uL elution to concentrate the sample by ssDNA/RNA Clean~ kit (Zymo)
4. qPCR
