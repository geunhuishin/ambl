## week 11

### SENSE-seq condition optimisation (record, refer to the week10 for original protocol)

> continued from last week

- protocol (until cell extraction) and results

  1. inoculate LC-E75 dtyrR (tyrA, pykF, ctrl, aroG-targeting sgRNA harbouring plasmids) to Km supplemented M9 minimal media and incubate overnight at 37*C, 180rpm.
     - from 23:00 until (next day) 9:00, for 10 hours.
     
  2. 1/100 dilute overnight culture media to fresh M9 minimal media (+Km), same incubation condition.
     - cell growth varied from 0.5 to 1.2 (highest value for LC-E75 dtyrR)
     - instead of 1/100, OD600 value was set to 0.05 and grown for 4 hours.
     - after 4 hours, OD600 value was near 0.5.
     
  3. prepare 250 ml flasks (samples*3) for biological triplicate.
     - prepare 3x volume, add supplements (Km and aTc) and distribute.
     - make initial OD600 = **0.005**
       - 500 ul of cell media (OD600 = 0.5) + 50 ml of fresh media
       
  4. extract 5ml of cell media when its OD600 value reaches at:
     - ~~0.1 ~ 0.2 (early)~~
     - ~~0.2 ~ 0.4 (mid)~~
       - ~~0.4 ~ 0.8 (late)~~
          unlike the original plan, cell media was extracted at **four** different time points.

  5. centrifuge extracted cell media at 3,200 rpm for 10 minutes and discard supernatant.
  
  6. transfer the remaining supernatant and cell pellet to 1.5 ml ep tube, centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and discard supernatant.
  
  7. keep them inside the deep freezer and proceed to next step later.

### sgRNA switch from barcoded PheSen plasmid

- object: using barcoded sgRNA plasmid library and change the sgRNA sequence to the desired ones.

- protocol:
  1. PCR amplification of the sgRNA cassette from the barcoded PheSen plasmid library (EcoWG1-PheSen-BC).
     - primer set (refer to the table below)
     - PCR condition:
       - 98*C, 3 min
       - 94*C, 15 sec
       - 64*C, 30 sec
       - 68*C, 30 sec
       - repeat 35 cycles (from step 2)
       - 68*C, 3 min
       - 4*C, hold
       
  2. gel electrophoresis for 60 minutes at 50V
     - add 1 ul of PCR product after adding relevant volume of loading dye.
       - mix loading dye well.
       
  3. gel extract and purify the PCR product 

  4. golden gate assembly for the ctrl sgRNA and the rest of the sgRNAs can be done using TEDA assembly.
     - golden gate assembly:
     - TEDA assembly:
- notes:
